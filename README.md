# Auto-Calibrated-Si5351A-Quadrature-IQ-VFO-Project
This is a VFO using the very popular Si5351A clock generator board to generate 80 â€“ 6 meter I/Q signals at outputs CLK 1 and CLK 2. Frequency and time accuracy are maintained by a highly accurate temperature compensated DS3231 real time clock (RTC) board.
